# 🦅 Red Eagle

**Red Eagle** is an interactive 3D web experience inspired by the Atmos Awwwards-winning website, built using [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber). This project showcases a fully immersive scrolling journey through the sky, complete with clouds, an eagle in flight, and animated text transitions. It demonstrates the power of Three.js in a modern frontend stack to create visually stunning web interfaces.

## 🌐 Overview

This project is based on the tutorial **"Reproduce Atmos Awwwards 3D Website with React Three Fiber"**, where we recreated the dynamic, award-winning experience in a step-by-step process.
